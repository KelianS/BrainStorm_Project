## Specifications :

```
  Base :
    Control a bluetooth 4.0 robot with an android smartphone.
    Create an app compatible to link and control the robot from our smartphone.
    Connect a 'MindWave Mobile 2 - NeuroSky' bluetooth 4.0 electroencephalogram to our app.
    Control the robot with data from the electroencephalogram.
    Add a database to memorise all actions
    Bonus : Use database to make the robot come back to where it start.
```

### Installing

What things you need to install the software and how to run :

```
  Prerequisites : If app already instaled it's recomended to unistall or delete storage.
```

```
  Instalation : With Android Studio, nothing specific.
```

## Running the app

```
  Step one : Wait untill app sucesfully scan your bluetooth device. (and then click on it)
    If it does not : Try to restart the app to make sure you accepted the uses of localisation data.
                     Try to reScan using the `Scan` button from trop right corner.
                     Make sure the robot is turned on.
                     
  Step two : Wait a fiew time untill your device is properly connected to your phone. (pretty quick here)
    If it does not : Try to restart using the button from top right corner.
    If it still does not : Retry from step One.
                     
  Step three : Turn on the bluetooth helmet and then hit `Headset` button
  
  Step four : Wait again till helmet is connected.. 
    If it does not : Retry from step three. (again)
    If Helmet is connected and show no signal or state :  Restart from step One. (sorry). 
```

## How to :

```
  On control activity (when device is connected) :
  
    Signal -> Quality of the positioning of the helmet.
    State -> Connection status of the helmet.
    Blink -> Virtual led that indicate if you blink (in yellow).
    
    Mod -> Indicate the mod you're running on (Grey = desactivated / 
                                               Yellow = Activated but not triggered /
                                               Green = Triggered)
    
      | Focus -> A number between [0;100] that indicate your focus level (with the helmet)
                 When your focus > 80, it unlock a boost mod for the motors to go faster than the others, but you need to stay focus ;)
    
      | Meditation -> A number between [0;100] that indicate your meditation level (with the helmet)
                When you're about to fall asleep(meditation >80), the robot take the control to drive itself and avoid a imminent collision
      
      | Reverse -> When triggered, the robot goes back from where it comes. To trigger it you need to do an eye blink.
    
    Buttons : 
    
      | DataBase -> Show database in another activity. (Only clickable when is connected to a device)
    
```
